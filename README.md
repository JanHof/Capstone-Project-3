# Capstone-Project-3
This is project 3 in the Data Analytics level of HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp.

I downloaded the 'Global Dams Database 2020'(https://energydata.info/dataset/global-dams-database/resource/f229335d-04b5-4e95-bc59-330e8e6b5743)
from the Enrgydata.info website ( https://energydata.info/dataset/global-dams-database/resource/f229335d-04b5-4e95-bc59-330e8e6b5743),
which contains information on various dams across the world, their surface area, and potential capacity for potential PV installation.  

I then cleaned and sanitised the data and performed exploritory data analysis on the cleaned data in the dam_data-checkpoint/ipynb
(https://energydata.info/dataset/global-dams-database/resource/f229335d-04b5-4e95-bc59-330e8e6b5743).

I wrote a report on the dataset, cleaning process and vsualisation findings in EDA1.doc( https://github.com/JanHof/Capstone-Project-3/blob/main/EDA1.docx).
